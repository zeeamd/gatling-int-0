From a user's standpoint the additional characters can give APL a special elegance and concision not possible in other languages using symbols visually mnemonic of the functions they represent. On the other hand it can lead to a ridiculous degree of complexity and unreadability like when the symbols are strung together into a single mass without any comments. It can be unreasonably difficult and time consuming to enter then later edit those APL statements. All APL symbols are present in Unicode  in the Miscellaneous Technical (Unicode) Miscellaneous Technical range cite web url http //unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf format PDF title The Unicode Standard 5.1 Code Charts Techinical Symbols U+2300-U+23FF accessdate October 12 2008 work Unicode Standard 5.1 publisher Unicode Consortium date </ref> although some APL products may not yet feature unicode and some APL symbols may be unused or unavailable in a given vendor's implementation.
